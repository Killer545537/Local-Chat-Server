# Local Chat Server

This is a pet project of mine which idk if solves an actual issue but is a fine idea.\
It is a chat server hosted locally, so that people on the same local network can send (just text for now) messages
without relying too much on external services. For this reason, I think rolling out my auth for people to just
simply store their emails and passwords is better, but it does around the fact that I don't know `Clerk`.\
For now, I'll just use JWT\
